# Module 10 Challenge:  Team Profile Generator

This application prompts users to input information on the employees at their business to create an HTML page for a "team profile."  The user will use Node.js and the installed Inquirer package to access the programmed prompts.

This application was made with assistance from TA's, tutors, and a review session held for the class.

An example of the HTML page created using this app is shown in the screenshot below:
